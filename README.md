Blackjack-Game
==============
This is a very simple blackjack game.
All input and output is achieved using javax.swing.JOptionPane

I really enjoyed working on this project even though getting started was challenging.
This is my third attempt at this project. Third times the charm.
The first two times I didn't properly think it through and started coding before I knew what I was trying to achieve.
The third time I started on paper. I drew out a flow chart of the game before I started coding.
This worked much better as it was clear in my head what I was doing.
I decided to create two classes; one for the playing cards and then a Deck class that utilises the Card class.
